oops : object oriented programmings 
js is not purely oops based but it supports the principle of oops

4 principles
encapsulation: it hides the inner working and only expose the essential parts so it acts as a capsule 

abstraction : hiding the complex details of an objects and exposing only the necessary parts 

polymorphism : it allows same method to have different implementations in derived classes 

inheritance : it allows us to  inherit the methods and properties from the main class

let obj={
    name:"john",
    age:23
}

in oops we do not create an object instead  we create a blueprint of an object  known as class 


class > methods >properties 

class >new property > constructor method 

methods are always accessed with dot .
